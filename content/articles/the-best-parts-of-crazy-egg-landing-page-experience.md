Crazy Egg is a website optimization tool that helps you see what visitors are doing on your website.

Crazy Egg was founded in 2005 and it is being used by over 300,000 websites today. That's crazy - just like their name.

Last week, I doubled down to find out the incredible parts of Crazy Egg's landing page experience that make it stand out.

Let's start the experience.

#### The SEO Hook

Crazy Egg uses SEO and content marketing to get visitors to the landing page.

When you search for "best homepage examples" on Google, the post from Crazy Egg blog ranks at the top:

#### A section as a Call-to-action (CTA)

The blog post lists all the 31 best homepage design examples and it follows up with a creative call-to-action at the end.

The CTA is not a button. A button will not work. Crazy Egg has to relate the user's search intent ( how to design the best home page ) with the product. This needs more than a simple button to get the user interested in it's product.

Therefore, Crazy Egg uses a small section that builds the case on how Crazy Egg can help you create the best homepage. Here is a screenshot of the CTA section:

This CTA builds the case in four steps:

1. Framing the problem
2. Expanding on the problem
3. Sharing the possible solution
4. Telling how Crazy Egg solves the problem

#### Landing page breakdown

You might have noticed a "user behavior reports" link in the last line of CTA section. Clicking on the link takes you to the following landing page:

Crazy Egg uses repetition and consistent messaging to justify the visitor of their solution. Here's a breakdown of how Crazy Egg does it:

1. Repeats the pattern of how the problem was framed. **Problem:** Find out what's working and what's not on Homepage. **Headline:** See where people click and where they don't with Snapshots.
2. The sub-headline shares the outcome of using the product. **Sub-headline:** And know exactly where to put your most important CTAs.
3. Clear call-to-action to guide the user to what to do next.
4. Handle the objections that the visitor might have. **Objection:** Is there any free trial? **Handled:** Free 30 days trial.

**Next I signed up** for Crazy Egg. And yes that means, I gave my credit card details and info to Crazy Egg. All of that so that I can share the Crazy Egg's welcome email breakdown with you.

#### Welcome email breakdown

Crazy Egg welcome emails focuses on helping the user to get started. If the user does not use the product, their chances of converting are very low.

The email can be broken down into four key sections:

1. Make the next step sound easier.
2. Use repetition to highlight the pain point and motivation.
3. Offer help and share resources.
4. Show that a real person sent it.

#### Key takeaway

The takeaway of the Crazy Egg landing page experience is to **use consistent messaging** across all touch points. It helps the visitor understand how your product can take them from where they are (a normal home page) to where they want to be (the best home page for their website).

#### Wrapping up

That's a wrap.

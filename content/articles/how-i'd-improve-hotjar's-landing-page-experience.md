Hotjar is a tool that helps marketers, product managers and UX designers to understand how users behave on the website.

And in the words of the founder:

Hotjar creates content around their main product features to attract their target audience.

For example, if you wanted to create a poll on your website to understand your visitors, the first thing you do is Google some poll examples.

They have got a post that lists 20+ poll examples from real websites and ranks well because of their domain authority.

The above post (like every Hotjar’s post) ends with an offer that relates the visitor’s motivation with a relevant feature of Hotjar.

For example, the post is about poll examples. The motivation of the visitor is to collect feedback from the visitors and Hotjar links it with their feedback survey feature.

I like the offer but I’d tweak the headline to further match the visitor’s intent. E.g. “Ready to create a poll and start learning about your visitors?”

The above CTA takes you to a dedicated landing page. The copy of the landing page revolves around the idea of understanding your users to gather feedback.

**But there is a messaging mismatch between the CTA and the landing page copy.** The headline is framed in a different way than CTA, the sub-headline does not gets into the how and the button text is not descriptive.

Here’s how I’d improve the landing page copy:

1. Reuse bits of copy from the offer in the landing page (highlighted in green).
2. Expand on where the user wants to be (highlighted in blue).
3. Use a descriptive CTA ( Set up your survey now ) that also handles objections (Is credit card needed? Is it free?).

The (Try it free) CTA on the landing page takes you to the sign up page. The sign up page is clean and simple.

It does help the visitor to focus on signing up but **there is no copy on the signup page to match the user’s intent.**

<dynamic-image path="hotjar/User journey 1-4 Hotjar.png" alt-text="Hotjar's sign up screen" fig-caption="Hotjar's sign up screen"></dynamic-image>

I’d improve it by adding copy on the user’s intent (to collect user feedback) and how Hotjar helps the user in its goal (by creating a survey).

I’d also restate that Hotjar is free to get started (Free to get started. No credit card needed).

I signed up for the free tier to try out Hotjar on LandingPagesFeedback.com and receive the welcome email.

The first impression of the welcome email did not stand out. It had no human connection and did not provide any hint on the next desired action.

Here’s how I’d improve it:
1. Add a human touch
2. Talk about the action that will bring the user closer to their goal

<dynamic-image path="hotjar/Welcome Email Breakdown 1.png" alt-text="Hotjar's welcome email subject line" fig-caption="Hotjar's welcome email subject line"></dynamic-image>

Getting into the email body, the first section focuses on the next action that Hotjar wants you to take (add tracking code to the site).

**The messaging is inconsistent** and it does not relate to the user’s intent (get feedback from visitors) as well as the purpose of signing up (create a survey).

<dynamic-image path="hotjar/Welcome Email Breakdown 2.png" alt-text="First section of the Hotjar's welcome email" fig-caption="First section of the Hotjar's welcome email"></dynamic-image>

Here’s how I’d rewrite the first section:

1. Match the headline with the user’s intent.
2. Restate the purpose of signing up.
3. Drop the username (obviously).
4. Make the CTA descriptive.

The customer support section is written incredibly well. It is written how a person talks.

Here is a step by step breakdown on how you can write the same:

1. Start with a personal headline.
2. Show that a real human being is there to help you.
3. Offer help for the desired action.
4. Share the possible options.
5. If possible, offer an alternative way.
